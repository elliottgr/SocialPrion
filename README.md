# Prion mediated social interaction
This repository contains code developed while modeling the yeast GRA+ prion system. The included files are all Pluto notebooks with the following functionality:

* **PrionODE.jl** : Implements the base model and allows interactive experimentation with parameters
* **derivativePlots.jl** : Explores derivatives of the model for varying population and parameter values
* **equilibriumTesting** : Uses Symbolics.jl to identify model equilibria and their stability
* **posterFig.jl** : Code used to generate the poster figures presented at Evolution 2023
